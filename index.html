                Message Design
            </h2>


            <p>
                Message design is a web-design company with a different philosophy than most companies. They care more about helping nonprofit organizations, artists and cultural organizations, than earning money. Kristin Walstad is the founder of this company, and I have gotten an interview with her. Kristin`s voice is sweet and nice.
            </p>
            <div class="sitat">
	            <p>
	            	<i>-	It is natural for me to use my resources to pursue what I believe in. I believe in good design`s power to reach out with a message. But the message must be of real value. Without a strong cause and a real purpose, design can be nothing more than pretty icing. I really want to contribute to society, and having a social profile was a natural choice."

            	Her customer list signals great interest in the arts and spiritual world. The singer Helene Bøksle, Franzisca Aarflot Production and Edel Design all have benefited from her services.<br>
            	<br>
				She has run her own design company for twelve years. Previously she worked as a Communication Advisor for some years, mostly in non-profit organizations.

           	<p>
           		I really want to ask her how she got interested in web-design, and how she got into this job. My own interest for computers started at an early age. From playing "Flåklypa" sitting on my fathers lap as a 4-year old toddler, to game playing  as a boy, it has been a natural way to move on to web coding. Computer games triggered my curiosity for how the rest of the computer worked. It fascinates me how much a web browser can do with just some lines of code. I therefore spend a lot of spare time to learn HTML and CSS. When we got this English assignment I got excited. This was a chance to interview someone who worked with my special interest. As for my initial question, Kristin`s answer is simple: It all happened through work.

    				<i>-	Knowledge about shapes and colors in general are important. It is also useful to have a strategic mind regarding what the clients goals and objectives are, which position they want to take in the market and so on. When it comes to interaction design, I don’t have such great skills, but I usually follow conventions made by bigger companies and the government. It’s also a good thing to have an interest and some talent with fonts.</i>

    			-	How many people are working in your company? She seems a bit surprised about the question. She is the only employee. Whenever she and a client have agreed on a concept for a design, she makes the design in Photoshop. She then sends the whole Photoshop file to another company, which will make an interactive website out of it in HTML/CSS. </i>

                This seems a bit lonely to me. Kristin agrees. She misses colleagues. However, the positive side of working alone is that she can choose her own work time.

                 She can choose exactly what projects she wants to take. This means she can focus on taking jobs from nonprofit organizations, artists and cultural organizations.

            Now we are on to the big issue: How she manages the financial funding. She needs the freedom to pick high income jobs as well as to be able to offer others a reasonable prize.  This freedom is important to her because making a website is generally expensive. Small nonprofit organizations do not have the funds to go to a big web-design company and create a super nice website.
            </p>
            <p>
                How has she solved the puzzle of making things work out in practice? The answer is a bit disappointing: She has another job as well. The firm started out as full time, but is now only a part time job. Hearing about a typical day is interesting anyway.

            It seems like Kristin really enjoys her work and makes a difference. I am intrigued by the way she combines her ideal interests and her talents as a web-designer. I am not yet sure if this is the occupation I want to work in, but now I feel I have a wider understanding of web-design as a tool. If Kristin can run her own business, why can`t I? I am sure this interview will have an effect on what I choose to do after Melsom VGS.
